I created Tic-Tac-Toe in java by using a GUI window to represent the game space, making each of the squares a buton with a text box behind it.  The bord object ceeps track of which squeres belong to who, and whos turn it is. When you click on one of the butons it will turn invisible and the text box behind it will fill in with eather an X or an O depending on whos turn it is.

To create the soler system in XMA, I began with looking up and creating a varioble the size, distence form the Sun, and orbit speed of each of the 8 planits. I then reduced the size of each of the planites as mutch as I could without making them invisoble. I tryed to maintain it to scail as much as I could but I had to reduce the sun by 2 extra digets and the gass gients by 1 extra diget. I then reduced the distence between each planet as much as I could without having them overlap but I was still unable to get them all to render on the screan. Then I made each of them rotate around the sentral pont of the sun at a fraction of there natrul orbit speed.
